SPECTRA: Splicing-based Pattern Extraction and Clustering using TRAnscriptomics
=========================================

**SPECTRA** is an end-to-end pipeline for discovering patient subtypes using alternative splicing data. It leverages an iterative clustering approach to identify stable and dominant splicing patterns across samples.

It is an modernized, efficient, faster, and more modular reimplementation of the OncoSplice algorithm and allows users to implement either through the command line or through classic step-by-step workflow.
