Starting with PSI Matrices
===============================

This section is under active development.

This tutorial will cover using SPECTRA when starting from **PSI matrices** (percent spliced in) as input for patient subtype discovery.

Example (to be updated):

.. code-block:: python

    import spectra

    psi_matrix = "path/to/psi_matrix.csv"
    spectra.run_pipeline(psi_matrix, output_dir="results/")

Additional parameters and workflow steps will be added here.
